            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>I would like to got to one of two schools Millikan or McBride. I would like to go to McBride because of it's technology program. On the other hand I would like to go to Millikan due to the fact that most of my friends are going, also I have a few people that are recomending that I go to this school. At this point in time I am not completely decided on which of the two schools I will go to.</p>
